You are an expert game developer. Build a fully functional, polished Flappy Bird clone that matches the original game 1:1 in behavior and feel.

TECH STACK / RUNTIME
- Use HTML + CSS + JavaScript (Canvas 2D).
- Must run in a single Replit web project with an index.html entry point.
- No external assets required; generate graphics with canvas drawing. (Optional: lightweight SVG or simple base64 sprites if needed, but keep it self-contained.)
- No build step. Just open and play.

CORE GAMEPLAY (MATCH ORIGINAL)
- Bird physics: gravity, flap impulse, terminal velocity, and rotation/tilt behavior that visually matches (nose up on flap, gradually tilts down while falling).
- Single tap / spacebar causes flap. Holding does nothing special.
- Pipes: pairs of top/bottom pipes with a gap, constant horizontal speed, randomized vertical gap placement within a sensible range.
- Collision: accurate hitboxes (reasonable approximations), including ground and pipes.
- Scoring: score increases by 1 when the bird successfully passes the center line of a pipe pair.
- Difficulty/feel: pipe spacing and speed should feel like classic Flappy Bird (not too easy, not impossible). Use tuned constants and keep them easy to adjust.

GAME STATES / UI
- States: "READY" (start screen), "PLAYING", "GAME OVER".
- READY screen: show title text and “Tap/Space to start”. Pipes should be visible but not moving OR move only after first flap (choose the classic behavior: game starts moving on first input).
- GAME OVER: freeze gameplay, show final score and best score, show “Tap/Space to retry”.
- Best score persists using localStorage.
- Add simple UI: score displayed top-center during play.

AUDIO (SELF-CONTAINED)
- Implement sound effects using Web Audio API (no external files):
  - flap
  - score (ding)
  - hit (collision)
  - die (ground impact / game over)
- Add a mute/unmute toggle (small icon button). Persist preference in localStorage.

VISUALS / POLISH
- Background: parallax feel (at least a scrolling ground + static sky gradient). Ground should scroll continuously while playing.
- Pipes: classic green pipe look with top/bottom caps (drawn with canvas shapes).
- Bird: simple but cute (circle/body + wing) with rotation.
- Pixel-ish UI styling is a plus but keep it clean.
- Ensure consistent rendering on high-DPI displays (handle devicePixelRatio scaling).

CONTROLS
- Desktop: Spacebar, Up arrow, and mouse click to flap.
- Mobile: Touch / tap to flap.
- Prevent page scrolling on space/touch while playing.

QUALITY / CODE REQUIREMENTS
- Clean structure with classes/modules: Game, Bird, PipeManager, UI, AudioManager.
- Deterministic update loop: requestAnimationFrame with delta time.
- Include a settings/constants section at top for tuning physics and difficulty.
- Include comments explaining key constants and collision logic.
- Must be robust: restart works reliably, no memory leaks, pipes reset correctly, score resets, best score persists.

FILES TO CREATE
- index.html (canvas + UI elements)
- style.css (layout, buttons, responsive)
- script.js (all game logic)

DELIVERABLE
- Provide the full code for all files with clear separators.
- Make sure the app runs immediately in Replit by pressing Run and opening the web view.
